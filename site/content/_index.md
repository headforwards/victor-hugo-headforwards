blurb:
  heading: Why Outsource?
  text: >-
    Our business model is different to most other outsource software companies.
    We create dedicated teams for specific projects and never switch members to
    other projects, nor do we have team members 'waiting on the bench' which
    ultimately drives costs up.
intro:
  heading: What We Offer
  text: >-
    We specialise in creating partnerships with our clients where we provide
    dedicated teams of people working to help them achieve their business goal.


    Our primary aim is to work with you, our client, to create and deliver
    software that brings you business value.


    We thrive when creating software that delivers our clients tangible business
    value, and we’re fortunate enough to be able to do it in a place we love and
    find inspiring.

    Sticking to our core values of happy clients, great software, and effective
    software teams, enable us to produce work we are proud of.

      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
      fall in love with in our shop.

  heading: Our values
  text: >
    At Headforwards this understanding and passion is firmly rooted in our three
    core values:


    Happy Clients


    Great Software


    Effective Software Teams



    These intertwined values guide our decision making from the strategic to the
    tactical to the day-to-day.


    At Headforwards we are committed to delivering business value for our
    clients through their software and software choices.


    Flip that on it’s head and you have our definition of great software:
    enabling clients to achieve their business objectives.


    In order to create this great software we believe in bringing together
    excellent software professionals and giving them the ability to work
    together effectively and efficiently as a team.


    We believe in people.


    The people we work with are an integral part of our business, and we believe
    in treating them in that way.

    Company culture is something we think carefully about, and try to empower
    our team to have the right work life balance.


    This ultimately leads to a happy and productive workplace where people are
    creating work they are proud of.
