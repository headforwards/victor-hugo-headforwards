## How we Work

Firstly we listen to you and your software needs. Once we fully understand the outcome that you want, we can propose and create an outsource software solution that will enable you to achieve your goals.

If you have an existing software development team. It is important to know how you want your new outsource team to work with them.

**Will they be working together?**

Or are they a completely separate entity? We take the lead from you on this.

The next stage is to discuss different team options. Based on your indications we will provide you with a number of options (team illustrations) which will include different role combinations and salaries.

This process allows us to get a clearer idea of the perfect team for your project.

## Recruitment

Our recruitment process is one of the key features that sets us apart from the crowd.

We don’t have developers “waiting on the bench” driving up costs. We recruit the perfect people for your specific project thus ensuring its success.

### We have a well-defined application process

Once the desired roles for your team have been agreed we look at our CV bank to see if we have the right applicants already on file. We would then market the role through our various channels.

We conduct the first round of interviews remotely and if we feel the candidate would be a good fit, they will also be sent an online test to judge their technical ability.

You are invited to join in the next round of interviews, where we only put people forward who we know would perform in the role. Then you get to make the final decision on who is the right fit for you and your team.

**Requirements:**

Software development is a continual process, requirements are constantly added and sometimes priorities will change. It is important to be flexible and that is one of the reasons why an Agile development process is so effective.

It is important to constantly review and react to the work being done, and to make decisions based on these retrospectives. This is true not only in terms of the software we create but in us ensuring we have an effective team working for you.

Effective collaboration between you and Headforwards enables us to create quality software that delivers value to your business.

## The Benefits

Working with Headforwards allows you to create excellent software whilst concentrating on your core business. You will have access to a previously untapped pool of resources. Outsourcing with us also means you can easily scale up the project without overhead concerns.

You‘ll also benefit from our Agile toolkit, which can be tailored to your needs. We can coach you along your Agile journey if you are just starting it, and we can help even the most advanced Agile practitioners advance.

For example, we have successfully implemented Continuous Delivery on a number of projects and our clients are seeing the financial benefits of this. Implementing these new technologies and ideas enables you to get to market much quicker, helping you stay ahead of the competition.

Our model may be different to most outsourcing companies, but it has proven to be very successful. It offers flexibility. The process can be led and adjusted by you as the project unfolds. As our projects have a minimum timeline of 12 months we are able to recruit the best possible team for you.

We are gaining a reputation for being a progressive place to work, and the company culture we have worked so hard to perfect is attracting developers from all over the world.

Our passion for Agile development allows complete flexibility throughout our project and means the team can be moulded around you and your projects needs. The team won’t have distractions from other work, as they will work solely for you. They will never be switched onto any other projects for other clients. We take the time to find out your needs and we tailor our package to you which enables us to create something special that performs for you.

## Added Value

We have a very high staff retention rate, which is mutually beneficial. You won’t suffer from a lack of continuity or loss of knowledge on your project like you would outsourcing to a traditional agency or somewhere with a high churn rate of people.

Being based in Cornwall we can offer our team a fantastic lifestyle, which can be a welcome relief after the city. Surfing on lunch breaks, coastal walks at the weekend and fantastic cuisine are just some of the fantastic things Cornwall can offer. Having a good work life balance enables our team to be happy, focused and productive.

We believe in offering our team professional advantage. We want to help them to continue to learn and grow professionally. We do this by encouraging thought leadership and knowledge sharing.

We hold a monthly internal conference called Headtalks, where we can share ideas and knowledge of the technical world with our colleagues. We also push the boundaries with new technologies, staying up to date with cutting edge methodologies.

If you are thinking of outsourcing your software development and this sounds of interest to you, please contact us.

**We would love to discuss your project.**
